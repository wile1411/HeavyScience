# HeavyScience

This KSP mod uses the in-game Scatter objects to represent the SurfaceSamples that Kerbals pickup. 

## Overview 
- SurfaceSamples can ONLY be stored in the supplied HeavyScience container
- SurfaceSamples Science can no longer be transmitted / reviewed while stored in container. Must be returned to KSC for Science points
- You can still review the experiment while held by a Kerbal
- When a Kerbal attempts to board a command module with a sample in hand, the player will be asked to either discard the sample or cancel boarding
- Adds 150Kg mass for **each** SurfaceSample when stored 
- *SurfaceSample mass in configurable in the settings.cfg*
- Collectable ROCScience items from DLC Breaking Ground are also able to be stored in the HeavyScience Container
- DeltaV budget considerations will likely be required when collecting multiple samples in one trip.
