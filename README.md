# HeavyScience

This KSP mod uses the in-game Scatter objects to represent the SurfaceSamples that Kerbals pickup. 


## Overview 
- SurfaceSamples can ONLY be stored in the supplied HeavyScience Container
- When a Kerbal attempts to board a command module with a sample in hand, the player will be asked to either discard the sample or cancel boarding
- Adds 150Kg mass to **EACH** SurfaceSample when stored 
- *SurfaceSample mass in configurable in the settings.cfg*
- The DLC Breaking Ground allows Kerbals to collect certain ROCScience items. These are also able to be stored in the HeavyScience Container and have mass applied.
- DeltaV considerations will need to be made when collecting a number of samples in one trip.
